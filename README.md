# FlowBook - Expense Tracker App ðŸ’°

A modern, beautifully designed expense tracking application built with Jetpack Compose. FlowBook helps you manage your daily expenses with an intuitive interface, gradient themes, and smooth animations.

## App Overview

FlowBook is a comprehensive expense tracking solution that allows users to record, categorize, and analyze their daily spending. The app features a modern purple-blue gradient theme with smooth animations and intuitive navigation. Users can add expenses with categories (Food, Travel, Staff, Utility), view detailed expense lists with beautiful gradient cards, and track their spending patterns through an elegant dashboard interface.

## AI Usage Summary

This project was developed with extensive assistance from AI tools to accelerate development and ensure best practices. ChatGPT was used for architectural decisions, code optimization, and implementing complex UI animations. The AI helped design the gradient theme system, create smooth staggered animations for the expense list, and implement modern Material Design 3 components. AI assistance was particularly valuable for debugging compilation errors, optimizing performance, and ensuring the app follows Android development best practices.
